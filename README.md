# Hello, I'm Nathan Neidigh

I'm a freshman Engineering student at Walla Walla University passionate about Robotics and Computer Science. Currently studying in Washington but based in Massachusetts, I thrive on serving my loved ones and bringing smiles to others.

ðŸ”­ **Currently Working On:**
- Independent Research Project:
> I am collaborating with Joseph Pennock on this project which focuses on developing a method of robot localization and pathing in dynamic environments and illustrates that method through a robotic demonstration. Research will be conducted on ways to localize robots in dynamic environments and how to generate real-time pathing for the robot. This will likely utilize machine learning and AI and culminate in a white paper. The working idea for the demonstration is an autonomous go-kart racing against a human driver.
- PharoGs Project:
> Under the advisement of Prof. James Foster, I am working on an open-source project to host Pharo Smalltalk in a GemStone environment.

ðŸŒ± **Currently Learning:**
- localization strategies
- Mechanics
